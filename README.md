# Yabroudy-Statcast-Project
This is was my final project that I worked on for my Data Interoperability class. For the project, I had to find a dataset that I wanted to work with and analyze and add visuals for my findings. I decided to work with the data that Statcast has on pitchers in the league. This program was originally done in Idle in python and I uploaded it here to GitHub. My final grade on the project was 100% and my final grade for the class was an A.
